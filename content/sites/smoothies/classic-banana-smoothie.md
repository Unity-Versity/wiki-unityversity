# Classic Banana Smoothie Recipe

Smoothies don’t get more iconic than this! The Classic Banana Smoothie is your go-to for a creamy, sweet, and oh-so-satisfying treat. Perfect for breakfast, a post-workout boost, or a lazy afternoon snack. Let’s dive into this potassium-packed bliss!

## Ingredients

- 2 ripe bananas (the spottier, the sweeter!)
- 1 cup almond milk (or your fave milk)
- 1 tbsp peanut butter (optional, but oh-so-good)
- 1 tsp honey (for that extra kiss of sweetness)
- 1/2 cup ice cubes (keep it chill)

## Instructions

1. **Prep**: Peel those bananas—give ‘em a good squish if you’re feeling dramatic.
2. **Blend**: Toss everything into a blender. Bananas, milk, peanut butter, honey, ice—go wild!
3. **Pulse**: Blend on high for 30-45 seconds until silky smooth. No chunks allowed!
4. **Serve**: Pour into a tall glass, sip, and feel the smoothie magic.
